# py_random_stuff
placeholder for very random stuff.

## random_art.py
A wonderful script that basicall draws a... very specific object (p3n1s3s), but with very random lengths and colors, in very random positions. If you are wondering why??? I was learning python and tkinter in my first year of university. And I was bored. Cheers and enjoy
